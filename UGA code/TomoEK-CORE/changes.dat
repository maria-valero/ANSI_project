1. I changed GMT_BUFSIZ variable for BUFFSIZE_NEW to fix the problem with the path name.
2. It helps to use files with names like 1000_event_1.dat
3. I changed in the function call_surface() and call_grd2xyz() the size of 

	//char staEvent[GMT_LEN16];
	//char grdfile [GMT_LEN32];
	//char outfile [GMT_LEN64];

by

	char staEvent[500];
	char grdfile [500];
	char outfile [500];

4. Initialize all these variables in ""
